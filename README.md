# Tech-from-the-Ground-Up
Hi! My name is Muthuraman Sivakumar, a rising Senior at the University of Texas at Dallas studying Information Technology and Systems. I want to learn everything about the computer and its applications so I can develop competency at every level. This repo serves to document my learning and the projects I build. Hope you enjoy it!
